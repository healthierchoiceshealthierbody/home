        <p>Did you know around 90% of hospital visits are stress related. This was unbelievable when I first heard it
            and had to double check with a quick google search. Why this matters is because health is the foundation 
            for experiencing joy in life. With wealth and no health we can't experience much joy in life, however without wealth but with 
            health we can still experience joy in life so 
            why not have the best of both worlds and experience a life with wealth and health. That's what I'm here to share. A simple
            15 minute routine that when done once daily is 5X more rejuvinating than sleep, decreases aging by 15 years
        contributes to neuroplasticity, grows gray matter in the brain that regulates emotions, memory, and motor functions,
        improces memory, enhances our senses and yes sex, and improces our relationship with ourselves, partner, friends, family
        money, health, and work. So now that we know the why, how do we do this practice? It's simple, we breath out for four seconds
        while saying let go, and breath in for two seconds while saying silently in our mind let go, repeating this process for 15 minutes.
         You'll notice when done once daily after three weeks all the benefits of this routine. For more detailed work with this routine 
        please email me at healthierchoiceshealthierbody@gmail.com I hope to hear from you! Alex</p>
