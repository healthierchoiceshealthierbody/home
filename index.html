        <p>Did you know around 90% of all hospital visits are stress related. This was so unbelievable when I first heard it
            that I had to double check with a quick google search, and to my surprise google matched what I heard. 
            Why this matters is because health is the foundation 
            for experiencing joy in life. With wealth and no health we can't experience much joy in life, however without wealth but with 
            health we can still experience joy in life. So, 
            why not have the best of both worlds and experience a life with wealth and health. That's what I'm here to share. A simple
            15 minute routine that when practiced daily is 5X more rejuvinating than sleep, decreases aging by 15 years,
        contributes to neuroplasticity - the brains ability to reform overtime and recover from damage, grows grey matter in the brain that regulates emotions, memory, and motor functions,
        improves memory, sleep, and our relationship with ourselves, partner, friends, family
        money, wealth, health, and work. Just like brushing our teeth this practice cleans our mind and needs to be performed once daily. 
            So now that we know the why, how do we perform this practice? It's simple, we breath out for four seconds
        while saying let during th first 2 seconds and go for the last 2 seconds, then breath in for two seconds while saying silently in our mind 
            let for 
            the 1st second and go for the 2nd second, 
            repeating this process for 15 minutes.
         You'll notice when done once daily after three weeks all the benefits of this routine. To confirm this information checkout google and the benefits of
            mantras, meditation, pranayama. For more detailed work with this routine 
        please email me at healthierchoiceshealthierbody@gmail.com I hope to hear from you! Alex </p>
